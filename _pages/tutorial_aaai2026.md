<h2 class="text-center tutorial-main-title">Foundations of Interpretable Deep Learning</h2>

<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;">
  Tutorial held in conjunction with <a href="https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-26/">AAAI 2026</a><br>

  Singapore EXPO (Room Garnet 218), Singapore<br>

  January 21, 2026 from 8:30 AM to 12:30 PM<br>

## Material

You can find our **tutorial slides** here ([pdf](/assets/documents/2026_AAAI_Foundations_Of_Interpretable_Deep_Learning_Tutorial_Slides_Final.pdf)).


The first part of our talk was inspired by our position paper on ["Symmetries of Interpretable Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12913).


A recording of our presentation can be found here ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1asgfetqidP8YYaaMtU5lFEhhDY1Mf4KV/view?usp=sharing)).

For a **complete bibliography** of the topics and works discussed in this tutorial, please refer to our [resources](/resources/) section.

## Schedule

Below is the expected (rough) schedule for this tutorial where we indicate next to each
section who will be presenting that section's material
(PB for "Pietro Barbiero" and MEZ for "Mateo Espinosa Zarlenga").

#### Required Background

Our material will assume a basic knowledge of ML (e.g., foundations of supervised learning, experimental design, basic probabilistic modelling, etc.), with particular emphasis on a solid Deep Learning foundation (e.g., tensor calculus, neural networks, backpropagation, etc.). Concepts that may require mathematical tools/expertise beyond those one would expect to be shared among the AAAI community will be (re)introduced in our tutorial.
